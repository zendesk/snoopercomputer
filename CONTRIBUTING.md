## Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** This project is still new, so please add unit tests with your PR if you can. This is more of a "strongly recommended" thing than a requirement.

- **Document any change in behaviour**. Make sure the README and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date. Also, make sure your PR description clearly describes your changes.

- **Create topic branches**. Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature**. If you want to do more than one thing, do more than one pull requests.

- **Send coherent history**. Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful and has a clear message. If you make a lot of intermediate commits while working on your own repo, please squash them down so each commit is meaningful and has a clear message before opening the PR.
